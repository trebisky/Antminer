Antminer S9 projects

These are various projects for the Zynq-7000 on an Antminer S9 board.

The projects here are:

1. zzyzx - send endless characters to console
1. printf - send endless messages, using a decent printf
1. mio_blink - blink the red/green LED via MIO and GPIO
1. board_files - board files for Vivado

After 11-2024 my work on the Antminer S9 moved to my Kyu project as
I focused my efforts on getting Kyu to run on Zynq, using the
Antminer as the first target board

[Kyu](https://github.com/trebisky/kyu) - the Kyu real time operating system

Also see my other Zynq related project respositories:
