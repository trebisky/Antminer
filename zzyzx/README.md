zzyzx - send endless messages to the console

The Antminer S9 uses uart1 (not uart0) for the serial console.
(somewhat to my surprise, so does the EBAZ-4205)

This is a modification of the "fish" demo for the ebaz.

This time I choose the name of an important city in California.

This program prints "zzyzx" endlessly on the serial port.
No "hello world" here.
